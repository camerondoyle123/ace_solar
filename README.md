This is a really bad .gif generator for the ACE solar magnetic field experiment.

Data source: http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/index.html

Data is pulled directly from the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft that studies and records matter comprising of energetic particles from solar wind, interplanetary medium etc.

This dataset primarily deals with the magnetic field strength (nT) surrounding the spacecraft during orbit across it's three axes of instruments.

There are both daily and hourly recordings of nT fields as part of the magnetic field experiment, which makes this dataset pretty good for developing cool animated graphs.

This repo seriously needs to be cleaned though!
